{"id": 199, "job title": "Taxi App - Taxicaller Like Software", "location": "Alta, Norway", "skills": ["Android", "Mobile App Development", "iPhone", "PHP", "Software Architecture"], "details": "I am looking for developers who already have developed taxi/uber like software, which includes iOS and Android app, and also includes driver app and customer app, admin backend panel and also backend panel for drivers, for drivers to change pickup rates, km rates, logo to upload themselves++. The app will be in one concrete language besides english, so this is not a multi language or national software. \n\nTaxicaller software is cloud based software, with gps tracking system connected towards google api, for customers to see where the booked taxi is. The taxi location should only be shown to customer when he has ordered a taxi. Taxi driver then get a sound notification whenever customer book a taxi, where he sees where the customers is going to be picked up and delievered to (address). There must be two functions on which taxi gets the notification for me to click a checkmark on in admin backend panel. 1) if i chose the closest taxi to customers adress the receive the notification. Here he got 1 minute to respond to that request before it goes to the next closest taxi. 2) all taxis (taxi group) in area gets notification. The first to accept it get the project.\nBy taxi group i mean that I should be able to add each taxi in a geographical group by cities (how have you put the flow on this in your app?). When a customer downloads the taxi app, and there are no taxis in his city (outside the range of maybe 60km), there should be shown a message \"no taxis available in your area\".\nI think we have to create a backend panel for each taxi for them to chose rates from monday-sunday with hourly options to chose rates, like the rates are higher between 1500-2400 (self defined rate in his admin panel) than on monday between 1400-1600. Each taxi should also be able to checkmark payment options (visa/mastercard/mobilepay/vipps) which he accepts. Like some on\u00f8y will accept visa. The only currency should be norwegian kroner. And the app itself should be for norwegian customers and norwegian language.\nEach taxi should be able to see how long they have driven through the start of the day (startup of the app), and how much theyve earned when they click on \"end day\" which shows the log, when they end their drive.\nIn customer app users must register a personal user profile, for ordering taxi. It seems like you have this implemented in your software.\nI have not tried [login to view URL] functions, but it seems like its just like many of you taxi apps. And if you go to their website and read faq and descriptions, you can find out what types of services they offer.\nAlso, a taxi logo must be able to be added for customers to see in customer app, but this I must add in my own admin panel, for each taxi.\n\nPlease try find out more about the functions and features in their software by visiting their website, to see the flow of their software and design, and read their faq. You can find their app on google play and app store.\n\nDo not bid if you don't already have a source code, and must create ecverything from scratch, as I am not willing to use big amounts from my budget on this project or long timeframe. The software must be presented within 1 month or less.\n", "time expire": "Open - 6 days left", "budget": "$750-1500 USD"},

However, is this game one cant simply max out a character and be good at everything because almost everything that the game leads you to do is based on rolling a dice, the higher you roll, the higher chance you have at achieving the goal you had. One common thing done throughout the game is if the player rolls the highest number possible, whatever the goal was is done in the most dramatic or amazing way. In DnD you can make a character based on race, class and personality. Which has an influence on the original stats. One example being that if you chose a big orc, you would have higher stats in intimidation and strength, but struggle with lower stats in stealth (this is not always the case)\n\nThe basic rundown in terms of things I would need is one player (the Dungeon Master) is someone in control of what the other players can see / interact with in the world. Unlike other games created, this should have no attempt at restricting the player. The only variable that decides whether the player can or can't achieve something is by the rolled number they roll for their dice.\n\nIn order to get it as accurate as possible, absolutely everything in this world must have a variable to be set on fire, walls could be broken and/or destroyed, locked doors must have a way to be picked to open, and even the smallest details have an interaction point with the characters.\n\nAnother mechanic thought of is that there is that the behavior of the character is controlled by the player, for example, attempting to stealth out in the open around npc\u2019s will not pretend like you're not there, instead it would raise the suspicion/confusion levels of a crowd, and could instead call you out for it. (but somehow making an exception for the highest rolled dice)\n\n\nThe two main ways that it would be meant to be played is in 3rd person free roam, and turn based combat. \n\nThink if it as mixing gta\u2019s movement and free roam, with pokemon's turn based combat.\n", "time expire": "Open - 6 days left", "budget": "$30-250 USD"},

My fiance and I meet in Jr High School and began dating in HighSchool. We are going on strong and have been together more then 15yrs and have a family of our own.  I need a letter wrote to the judge requesting he please take into consideration leniency when sentencing my fiance for the charges of violating a no contact order, which was put in place by the courts. I have never wanted a no contact order in place, I've never felt the need for one nor do I feel scared in any way by the man who is charged with violating a no contact order, 5 counts of it for making calls to me while he was in jail with a no contact order between us. Which is what lead us to the current situation we're dealing with now.  I would like the judge to know and point out that there are a few reasons which led him and I to have contact with each other even though the state had imposed this no contact order. 1st It has been difficult trying to be a family and raise our son up with a no contact order hanging over us. There was contact made to talk about our sons parenting plan and needs in order to allow our son to be able to see both his parents while we are dealing with this court case. I also want to let the judge know that I was recently diagnosed with a terminal illness and given an approximate of 1-2yrs left. I am not only dealing with the stresses of my illness and diagnosis but also having to go through it alone and being told I can't even talk with the man I've been with for over 15yrs, half of my life, and who is my family and have a child in common with. I want to be able to raise our son together like a family should but haven't been able to do so with a no contact order put in place by the courts. I want the judge to know and to please take into consideration why we made contact with each other and that given the short period of time I have left I only want to make the best of it and be able to spend my time around and with my family and the man I've been with for over half my life. I want to include that the defedent is sorry and takes responsibility for himself. I want to explain that I'm not giving any reasons or excuses to say that that makes it ok to break the law, I only ask that the judge consider our situation and take leniency when sentenceing. If possible I would like to ask the judge to be able to drop the no contact order so I can spend as much time as possible with my son and fiance(defedent) before my time here is up. I want the judge to know that when a person is told they are sick and have a terminal illness, that gives a whole new meaning and insight to the term  \"life is to short\". I understand it's not right and doesn't give anyone an excuse to believe that it's ever ok to break the law and violate a no contacted order for any reason but that the judge please take into consideration why it happened and what lead us to were we are now.  When we violated the contact order it wasn't done out to total disregard of the law but because of the need to be able to care of our son together and the harsh reality of knowing my time here is limited and all I wanted was to be allowed to contact the defedent.  I don't want to spend the rest of what time I do have here, alone. We've been together for over half my life, I love him and he loves me.  We both made mistakes just like anyone else has but we've always managed to make it through anything together. I want to ask the judge to please consider taking leniacy when sentencing the defedent as I don't have much time left.
